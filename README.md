# Global-Wheat-Detection
This project is about detecting wheat heads from outdoor images of wheat plants.<br>
I applied YOLOV3 architecture for object detection using tensorflow framework using this paper [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf).<br>
The dataset used in this project [Global Wheat Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/global-wheat-detection).<br>
